Notes on the input data format CSV files:
1.	The table is a smash together of the Terrestrial Indicators and Remote Sensing Indications tables from TerrADat.
2.	I added a field for the calculated weights (input to cat.analysis), and fields for the reporting units. Cat.analysis is capable of doing analyses for different sets of reporting units at once, the different reporting unit assignments for each point just need to be in separate columns.
3.	The second table (test_input_evaluated.csv) is an example of the type of table you would actually feed into cat.analysis (actually, you’d need to split it up first, but that’s easy to do). Things to note here are that I stripped out all of the indicators that weren’t being considered in the analysis. I also added columns that translate the original indicator values (retained in this table for posterity sake) into their classes (e.g., “suitable”, “unsuitable”, “marginal”; Nelson is working on the magic to make this happen in R, for now I made up benchmarks too). I called this the “evaluated” table, and I’d propose that this would be one of the standard outputs of the analysis workflow that we could include as an appendix to the report (or just link to the file).
